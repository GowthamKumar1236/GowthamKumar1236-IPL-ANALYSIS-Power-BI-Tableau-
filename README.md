IPL-Analysis

Problem Statement: The objective of this project is to visualize the winning team,top runscorer and wicket-taker for each IPL season(2008-2022) in Power BI and Tableau.

In Power BI, I created a canvas report to analyze which team won in the season and which players performed well in batting and bowling using formatting visuals.

In Tableau, I created a dashboard drag-and-drop interface to quickly generate informative visualizations, enhancing the understanding of IPL trends.

Created calculated measures and KPIs in Power BI, developed calculated fields in Tableau to evaluate batting and bowling performances.

Created a comparison summary of points in PowerPoint (PPT).
